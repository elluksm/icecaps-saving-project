# icecaps-saving-project
Perfect opportunity to sign up for a nice newsletter and help saving our planet!

## Project task
Save The Icecaps Inc seems to be a nice company to work for - it cares about potential users and tries to explain their ideas and 
requirements in a simple and thoughtful way. Of course some improvements in the specifications would be needed if we try to launch this as
a real project but it all can be easily improved in discussions and next planning meetings. More or less this all makes sense and seems
to be a nice and fun potential real life project.

I used this as an opportunity to refresh my Vue skills and catch the feeling of Vue specifics again as recent years I have been mostly working with
React and Angular. I used Boostrap-Vue library to get a bit nicer look and I think that subsription form overall looks quite good. 
Trying to keep it simple but stil nice looking and usable. :)

Included:
- technologies: mainly Vue and Typescript
- main priciples of good UX to make better user experience and get more donations
- used component state for web form (global state and Vuex seemed not needed before form is submitted)
- few testing examples to get a feeling about potential testing structure

I was not quite sure if I would like to provide my date of birth or income level as potential user. So I came up with idea to ask about how green 
to the planet our potential subsriber feel now. I think that this info could be later used for follow-up emails asking for more donations as a good
excuse because "not so green" lifestyle eventually leads to more quickly dissolving polar ice reserves :(

Out of scope:
- full test coverage
- even better form field validation with custom error and success messages (but in my opinion the most important validation for "donation amount" and "agreement
 to terms and conditions" already have some nice error messages implemented)
- SignUp Form could be splitted to smaller components (for example, seperate components for "Summary preview" and common input types to get them more 
 consistent throughout this app)
 - I didn't quite understand what was meant by "Javascript API familiarity" in a scope of this project
